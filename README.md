# What does AirBoard do?

* The application tracks any suitable target (for example, a pen) and uses the target to **draw in the air**. 
* The motion of the target is captured by a webcam. 
* The video from the webcam is processed by the computer to get an AR like **image overlay on top of the live footage**.

# Why do we need AirBoard?

## Arrival of Pandemic 

* The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 as well as the strict lockdowns imposed all over the world have had a devastating effect on various industries. 
* With businesses and ventures moving **online**, even **professions such as education have been pushed into a virtual mode of conduction**, thus leading to a mass, world-wide inconvenience for education practitioners. 
* **Teachers and professors used to the old-school methods of conducting classes have been forced to adjust to a new way of life**, with online classes as well as tests. But adjusting is not easy, given that most practitioners have spent years, if not decades adhering to old methodologies.

## Old School Methodologies and Practices

* Teachers have been facing difficulties with teaching through an online portal. **The lack of proper equipment at homes**, leads to greater difficulty in teaching to a wider audience. 

* Most teachers do not use digital writing pads, and hence have to resort to using the good old mouse to draw and explain concepts, leading to more squiggles than readable text. Digital pads with displays are often **expensive, and they also take some amount of time to get used to**.

With AirBoard, teachers will be able to use the air as their canvas, and will also be able to overlay over their screens. This will result in a slightly more natural method of teaching of concepts as well as reduce the costs by a vast margin, hence allowing practitioners some more comfort in teaching their students.
